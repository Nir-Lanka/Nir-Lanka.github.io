Svelte is a cool new "framework" that does everything to not be a framework at all. It has one of the best performance records in modern "frameworks", simply because it almost doesn't include a runtime at all!

While Svelte is in no way a big name, it's quite possible you've heard of it already. If you know what sets Svelte apart already, but need to see the in-depths, I suggest you read [this article on Compiling Svelte in Your Head](https://dev.to/tanhauhau/compile-svelte-in-your-head-part-1-7am). It's a great read where I learnt a lot.

Here's a not-so-simple Svelte snippet:

```html
<script>
	let count = 1;

	// the `$:` means 're-run whenever these values change'
	$: doubled = count * 2;
	$: quadrupled = doubled * 2;

	function handleClick() {
		count += 1;
	}
</script>

<button on:click={handleClick}>
	Count: {count}
</button>

<p>{count} * 2 = {doubled}</p>
<p>{doubled} * 2 = {quadrupled}</p>
```
